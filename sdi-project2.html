    <h2>Project 2:
    	The Birthday Party</h2>

<p>I decided to change my theme this week. Instead of doing the LegoLand theme like last week, I decided to change it A Birthday Party. Since my birthday is Saturday and e have a party planned it seemed like I could go a little further with this theme.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With changing my theme, I felt as though I had more options to build from with this Birthday Party theme. Since we visited LegoLand I thought I could get more ideas from the visit, but is was the complete opposite. So with the Birthday Party theme, I used the weather, the amount, of food, drinks, the guests that will attend. So in this assignment I hope it gave me more of a feel of what I am doing. I felt more confident this week hopefuly that transfers to the assignment.</p>
